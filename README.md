🚗 Vehicle Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Vehicle Price Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts the selling price of a vehicle based on its specifications and features. In the automobile market, vehicle prices vary depending on factors such as brand, model, year, mileage, engine type, fuel type, transmission, and body type. Accurately estimating a vehicle’s price manually can be difficult, especially when dealing with large datasets.

This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze historical vehicle data and identify patterns that influence vehicle pricing. The trained model can predict vehicle prices with good accuracy, helping buyers, sellers, and dealers make better decisions.

 🎯 Objective

* To predict vehicle prices using machine learning
* To understand the impact of different vehicle features on pricing
* To build an accurate and reliable regression model
